This is a project I am working on.

It not much right now but I will be push update once i get a good chunk of code done or it ends on a good spot.

11/17/18 - First push
	 - The code is far from done

11/18/18 - Added saving/loading
	 - I add a java class that when you pick your name it runs and see if it can find a save file with tht name,
	   if it does it load the data in the file. If not, it ask if yo want to create one and then if yes is say
	   then it dumps the data to a new file with your name as the name.
	 - I am not updatng th GameSoFar code because the save system won't fully work until I get the hut buildung
	   done.

12/2/18  - It would look like I did nothing but I rework alot of my code. Insead of have mutiply array that I need to carry
	   around everywhere as the player, I made a decate player class with the array inside and alot of meathods to eidt
	   thoghts array. I also moved the showInv and Save/Load meathods into the new player class.
	 - I will udate the GameSoFar code but save is still not fully working becasue the hut building is not done.
	 - Did not implanment the player class into the fight class yet
