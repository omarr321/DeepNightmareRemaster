This is a project I am working on.

It not much right now but I will be push update once i get a good chunk of code done or it ends on a good spot.

11/17/18 - First push
	 - The code is far from done

11/18/18 - Added saving/loading
	 - I add a java class that when you pick your name it runs and see if it can find a save file with tht name,
	   if it does it load the data in the file. If not, it ask if yo want to create one and then if yes is say
	   then it dumps the data to a new file with your name as the name.

	   I am not updatng th GameSoFar code because the save system won't fully work until I get the hut buildung
	   done.
